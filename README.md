Technology Choice Explanation
For this project, I have chosen to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my primary technologies for several reasons:
1.	Familiarity and Proficiency: My skills are strongest in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript compared to other programming languages. I have developed a solid understanding of these technologies, which allows me to efficiently implement features and troubleshoot issues.
2.	Direct Representation of Skills: This project showcases my proficiency in designing user interfaces and creating interactive web applications. HTML provides the structure, CSS offers styling, and JavaScript enables dynamic content and user interaction, allowing me to effectively demonstrate my capabilities.
3.	Local Development: Given the current constraints of not being able to host the project online, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows me to run the project locally using XAMPP. This setup is straightforward and enables me to showcase the project without requiring external hosting services.
4.	Web Standards: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundational technologies for web development. They are widely supported across all browsers and devices, ensuring that the application will be accessible to users without compatibility issues.
